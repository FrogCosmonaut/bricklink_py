### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WIP üõ†

This Python library provides a convenient wrapper for interacting with the Bricklink API. Bricklink is an online marketplace for buying and selling LEGO¬Æ bricks, sets, and minifigures.

With this wrapper, you can easily integrate Bricklink's functionality into your Python applications, allowing you to perform various operations such as searching for items, retrieving store inventories, managing orders, and more. It abstracts away the complexities of the API, providing a simple and intuitive interface.

### Key Features

- Item Search: Search for items on Bricklink using various criteria like keywords, category, color, and more.
- Store Inventory: Retrieve store inventories, including available quantities and prices.
- Order Management: Create, update, and retrieve order information, including order status, items, and shipping details.
- Catalog Information: Access detailed information about LEGO¬Æ items, including their categories, colors, and images.
- Price Guide: Get pricing information for items based on condition and quantity.
- Authentication: Provides methods to obtain and manage the necessary API tokens for authenticating requests.

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install bricklink-py
```

```python
from bricklink_py import bricklink

session = bricklink.Bricklink('credentials')
```

### Example

```python
from html import unescape
from bricklink_py import bricklink

# create session object
session = bricklink.Bricklink(
            consumer_key='your_consumer_key',
            consumer_secret='your_consumer_secret',
            token='your_token',
            token_secret='your_token_secret'
            )

# Price checker example
set_no = '75281-1'

set_item = session.catalog_item.get_item('SET', set_no)
set_name = unescape(set_item['name'])
set_weight = set_item['weight']
year_released = set_item['year_released']

price_guide = session.catalog_item.get_price_guide('SET', set_no,
                                                   guide_type='sold')
avg_price = float(price_guide['avg_price'])
currency = price_guide['currency_code']

print(f'The "{set_name}" set was released in {year_released}.')
print(f'It weights {set_weight}gr.')
print(f'Average sold price for last 6 months: {avg_price:.2f} {currency}')
```
Output:
```
The "Anakin's Jedi Interceptor" set was released in 2020.
It weights 360.00gr.
Average sold price for last 6 months: 41.27 EUR
```
